    <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

    <p>
        
        <b>Where exactly does Plantroots plant?</b><br>
        With the help of the German foundation and other supporters, the non-profit Mexican sister organization Plant-for-the-Planet A.C. became the owner of a total of 239 km2 of forest areas that have been plundered to varying degrees of intensity: They are located in the Mexican state of Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula, near the village of Constitución. Plant-for-the-Planet has promised, in addition to the platform, to plant 100 million trees itself. This will be done on such degraded areas, i.e. abandoned cattle farms or as enrichment plantations in forests, plundered mostly through illegal logging, and the subsequent protection of these restored areas. <br><br>

        <b>How is it documented that the trees are still standing years later?</b><br>
        It is important to realize at this point that Plant-for-the-Planet does not want to create a plantation with a precisely defined number of tree individuals that will still exist exactly like this after many years. Our goal is to remove carbon dioxide from the air, and the best way to do that is with a stable ecosystem that keeps growing on its own. In other words, it keeps growing and binding more and more CO₂. <br>

        With the donated trees – we plant up to 30 different species in Yucatán – we lay the foundation for such an ecosystem, which due to its biodiversity is less vulnerable to some of the consequences of the climate crisis such as drought, fire, floods, (invasive) insects and fungi. The forests we plant should take as much carbon dioxide out of the air as possible for as long as possible, and preferably more and more. And this is only possible with stable ecosystems that are resilient to almost any attack due to their biodiversity. <br><br>

        <b>How does Plant-for-the-Planet ensure that the trees grow well and survive?</b><br>
        Plant-for-the-Planet has the seedlings of up to 30 different tree species grown in an established tree nursery and then plants them out after four to six months. Planting takes place during the rainy season (around July to December), because the young plants have a particularly good chance of survival then. In the first few months, it is crucial to keep short the grass, which grows quickly and up to two meters high and competes with the seedlings for sunlight, water and nutrients. <br>

        No less important is the fact that we provide our employees with good training and pay them above the standard rate, instead of the daily wages, piecework payments or bonuses that are often the norm for plantations. This is because the satisfaction of all employees, who identify strongly with the trees, also contributes to the focus on the quality of the planting and care of the trees. Many of our employees regard the young trees almost like their children, whom they cherish and for whom they feel responsible. <br><br>

        <b>Are you collaborating with any other NGOs?</b><br>
        Yes, we are collaborating with other organisations, such as the WWF.

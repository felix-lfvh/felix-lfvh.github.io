        <p class="grid-container-2"><span>How many trees we planted</span><br><br>Our NGO has made a significant impact on the environment by planting 12 million trees. This accomplishment represents a major step forward in our mission to protect and preserve the planet for future generations. <br>

            The planting of these trees has had a positive impact on the environment in many ways. Not only have we helped to absorb carbon emissions and combat climate change, but we have also provided a home for countless species of plants and animals. Our reforestation efforts have also had economic benefits, such as increasing agricultural productivity and supporting local communities. <br>
            
            We are proud to have reached this milestone and will continue to work tirelessly to protect and preserve the environment. We believe that every tree counts, and we are committed to planting many more in the years to come. <br>
            
            We would like to thank all of our supporters for their help in making this accomplishment possible. Together, we can make a real difference in the fight against climate change and ensure a sustainable future for the planet.

        <p class="grid-container-4"><span>What it brings to the biodiversity</span><br><br>Planting trees is great for biodiversity because it provides habitat and sustenance for a wide variety of species. Trees support many forms of life, including birds, mammals, insects, and plants. By planting trees, we are helping to create new ecosystems and protect existing ones, providing a home for many different species and helping to preserve the planet's biodiversity. <br>

            Trees also play a crucial role in the food chain. They provide food and shelter for wildlife and help to maintain the balance of nature. For example, some birds and mammals rely on trees for their nesting sites, while other species rely on them for food and shelter. <br>
            
            In addition, trees play an important role in supporting the livelihoods of many communities. For example, they can provide resources such as firewood and non-timber forest products, which are crucial for the survival of many rural communities.
